            <h1>About SMPLTSK</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Built by a builder, for builders and trades</p>

            <h2>The Founder's Story</h2>
            
            <p>SMPLTSK was created by a registered builder who experienced firsthand the frustrations of ineffective communication in construction.</p>
            
            <p>Working remotely with clients, I needed to show them specific issues or requirements on-site. SMS and email seemed like solutions, but they had significant disadvantages. Text descriptions were often misunderstood, and attaching photos meant losing the context of exactly what needed attention.</p>
            
            <p>The breaking point came at the end of jobs when creating defects lists with clients. Walking through a project, we'd identify dozens of items that needed fixing or adjustment. I'd photograph everything and take detailed notes. But when it came time to pass this information to my workers, so much detail was lost in translation.</p>
            
            <p>Workers would receive written lists or photos without clear indication of what needed doing. "Fix the tile in the bathroom" could mean any of thirty tiles. "Touch up paint near the window" left them searching and guessing. The result? Repeat site visits, lengthy phone calls sorting out confusion, and mounting stress and frustration for everyone involved.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>"I needed a way to record the message once—clearly and visually—so everyone saw exactly the same thing."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>That's when SMPLTSK was born. It solved the core problem: allowing me to photograph an issue, mark the exact location on the photo, add a description, and send it to workers. One message, recorded once. No ambiguity. No lost detail.</p>
            
            <p>Workers could open the task on their phones and see exactly what I saw—with a red marker pointing to the precise spot. When completed, they'd change it to green. Everyone stayed on the same page. No repeat visits to clarify. No frustrating phone calls. No stress.</p>
            
            <h2>The Mission</h2>
            
            <p>Today, SMPLTSK helps builders, contractors, property managers, and trades communicate visually and effectively. It reduces the daily mental load, eliminates costly miscommunication, and provides completion tracking that gives everyone—from builders to clients to workers—confidence that nothing falls through the cracks.</p>
            
            <p>If you've ever dealt with workers forgetting tasks, clients frustrated by incomplete work, or your own stress managing it all—SMPLTSK was built for you.</p>
