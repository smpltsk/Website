                <div class="question">Is SMPLTSK free to use?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes! SMPLTSK is free to use with a limit of 6 tasks on 1 image. If you need more tasks or multiple images, you'll see a prompt to subscribe via the App Store or Google Play Store. Subscribers get unlimited tasks and images.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">Do my workers need to download the app?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>It depends. If you're a subscriber, you can send unlimited tasks to non-subscribers who can view them in a web browser and mark them complete. They'll receive a message with a link to open the tasks in their browser.</p>
                    <p>However, non-subscribers can only send 1 image with up to 6 tasks. To send more tasks or images, they'll need to subscribe via the App Store or Google Play Store.</p>

            <h2 class="category-header">Using SMPLTSK</h2>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">Can I add multiple markers to one photo?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes! Add as many markers as needed to a single photo. Each marker can have its own description and can be marked complete independently.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">How do I mark a task as complete?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Tap the red marker on any task and change it to green. This shows everyone that the work is finished. You can switch it back to red if additional work is needed.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">How are tasks organized in SMPLTSK?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>SMPLTSK uses four folders to keep your task batches organized:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sent:</strong> Task batches you've sent to others</li>
                        <li><strong>Received:</strong> Task batches others have sent to you</li>
                        <li><strong>Mine:</strong> Task batches you've created for yourself</li>
                        <li><strong>Drafts:</strong> Unfinished task batches you haven't sent yet</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To delete a task batch, press and hold it in any folder and follow the delete prompt.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">Can I edit a task after I've sent it?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>No. Once a task is sent, the photo, markers, and descriptions cannot be edited. The only thing that can be changed is the completion status—recipients can change markers from red (undone) to green (done).</p>
                    <p>If you need to communicate additional information about a task, use the in-app messaging feature to discuss details with the recipient.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">How do I share tasks with my team?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>SMPLTSK uses its own contact system. You can add contacts manually or import them from your phone's native contact list. Once added to SMPLTSK, you can send task batches to any contact.</p>
                    <p>If the recipient doesn't have the app, they'll receive a message with a link to view the tasks in their web browser. Subscribers can send unlimited tasks to anyone, while free users are limited to 1 image with 6 tasks.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">How do I communicate with recipients about tasks?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>SMPLTSK has a built-in messaging feature. You can send comments and messages directly within the app about any task. This keeps all communication in one place for speed and convenience—no need to switch to SMS or email.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">Does SMPLTSK work offline?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>You can view previously loaded tasks offline. Creating new tasks and sharing them requires an internet connection. Once a task is shared, recipients can view it offline after initial loading.</p>

                <div class="question">Where are my photos stored?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Photos and tasks are securely stored in the cloud using Firebase. This means you can access them from any device once logged in. Your data is backed up automatically and only accessible to you and people you share tasks with.</p>

                <div class="question">Is my data secure?</div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yes. SMPLTSK uses industry-standard encryption for all data transmission and storage. Your photos and tasks are private and only visible to people you explicitly share them with.</p>

                    <p><strong>Free accounts:</strong> Can send 1 image with up to 6 tasks. Perfect for trying SMPLTSK or occasional use.</p>
                    <p><strong>Subscriber accounts:</strong> Send unlimited tasks and images. Can send tasks to non-subscribers who can view and respond in their browser. Ideal for builders, contractors, and anyone managing multiple projects or workers.</p>
