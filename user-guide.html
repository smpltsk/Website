            <h1>User Guide</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Everything you need to know to use SMPLTSK effectively</p>
        </header>
        
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            
            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>Download SMPLTSK from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android). Create your account using your email address.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Free Version:</strong> SMPLTSK is free to use with a limit of 6 tasks on 1 image. If you need more tasks or multiple images, you'll be prompted to subscribe through the App Store or Google Play Store.</p>
            
            <h2>Creating Your First Task</h2>
            
            <div class="step">
                <p><span class="step-number">1</span><strong>Take a Photo</strong></p>
                <p>Open SMPLTSK and tap the camera button. Take a photo of the area where work needs to be done. You can also select an existing photo from your gallery.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <p><span class="step-number">2</span><strong>Mark It</strong></p>
                <p>Tap on the photo where the specific task needs attention. A red marker appears. You can add multiple markers to one photo if needed—each marker can have its own task description.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <p><span class="step-number">3</span><strong>Describe It</strong></p>
                <p>Tap a marker to add a description. Keep it clear and specific: "Replace this cracked tile" or "Touch up paint on this corner."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="step">
                <p><span class="step-number">4</span><strong>Send It</strong></p>
                <p>Add contacts to SMPLTSK by manually entering them or importing from your phone's contact list. Send your task batch to any contact. If they don't have the app, they'll receive a message with a link to view tasks in their web browser.</p>
            </div>
            
            
            <h2>Managing Tasks</h2>
            
            <h3>Marking Tasks Complete</h3>
            <p>When a task is finished, tap the red marker and change it to green. This provides visual confirmation that work is done. Your team and clients can see progress at a glance.</p>
            
            <h3>Organizing with Folders</h3>
            <p>SMPLTSK organizes your task batches into folders:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sent:</strong> Task batches you've sent to others</li>
                <li><strong>Received:</strong> Task batches others have sent to you</li>
                <li><strong>Mine:</strong> Task batches you've created for yourself</li>
                <li><strong>Drafts:</strong> Unfinished task batches you haven't sent yet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Navigate between folders to find and manage your tasks efficiently.</p>
            
            <h3>Editing Tasks</h3>
            <p>Before sending a task, you can edit descriptions, move markers, or make any changes. However, once a task is sent, it cannot be edited. The only change that can be made is marking it complete (red to green).</p>
            <p>If you need to communicate additional information, use the in-app messaging feature to discuss details with the recipient.</p>
            
            <h3>In-App Messaging</h3>
            <p>SMPLTSK includes a built-in messaging system. Tap any task to send comments or questions to the recipient. All communication stays within the app for speed and convenience—no need to switch between SMS, email, or other apps.</p>
            
            <h2>Best Practices</h2>
            
            <h3>Clear Photos</h3>
            <p>Take photos in good lighting. Get close enough to show context but not so close that the location becomes unclear. Think: "Will someone else immediately understand where this is?"</p>
            
            <h3>Specific Descriptions</h3>
            <p>Instead of "Fix window," try "Replace cracked pane—bottom left window." The marker shows WHERE, the description explains WHAT.</p>
            
            <h3>One Task, One Focus</h3>
            <p>If you have multiple issues in different areas, create separate photos. This makes it easier to track completion and prevents confusion.</p>
            
            <h3>Regular Updates</h3>
            <p>Encourage workers to mark tasks green as soon as they're complete. This keeps everyone informed and reduces follow-up calls.</p>
            
            <div class="tip">
                <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong>
                <p>Use SMPLTSK for defects lists at the end of projects. Walk through with clients, photograph and mark issues as you go. Instant punch list that everyone can see and track.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            
            <h3>Can't see markers clearly?</h3>
            <p>Zoom in on the photo. Pinch to zoom shows more detail around each marker.</p>
            
            <h3>Tasks not sending?</h3>
            <p>Check your internet connection. SMPLTSK needs connectivity to share tasks. Once shared, recipients can view offline.</p>
            
            <h3>Need to delete something?</h3>
            <p><strong>Delete a marker:</strong> Press and hold the marker on screen, then follow the delete prompt.</p>
            <p><strong>Delete an image from a task batch:</strong> If your task batch has multiple images, press and hold the selected image from the list of images at the top of the screen, then follow the delete prompt.</p>
            <p><strong>Delete entire task batches:</strong> Navigate to any of your folders (Sent, Received, Mine, or Drafts), press and hold the task batch you want to delete, and follow the delete prompt. This permanently removes the task batch.</p>
